# Bucket Problem Algorithm Application Project

## Project Overview
Our project delves into the fascinating realm of solving the Bucket Problem using a variety of search algorithms. This endeavor not only showcases our proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving but also highlights our ability to analyze and compare the effectiveness of different search strategies.

## Objectives
The primary goal of our project is to explore and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of various search algorithms in solving the Bucket Problem. Through meticulous implementation and thorough analysis, we aim to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, enabling informed decision-making in real-world problem-solving scenarios.

## The Bucket Problem
The Bucket Problem presents a captivating challenge: given a 5-liter bucket and a 3-liter bucket, how can we achieve a specific target volume of water, such as 7 or 4 liters, by performing a series of operations? These operations include filling and emptying the buckets, as well as transferring water between them without spillage.

## Implemented Algorithms
Our project features the implementation and evaluation of the following search algorithms:
- Simple search
- Backtracking search
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Uniform cost search
- Greedy search
- A* search
